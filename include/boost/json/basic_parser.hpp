/** An incremental SAX parser for serialized JSON.

    This implements a SAX-style parser. The serialized
    JSON is presented to the parser by calling to
    @ref write_some, @ref write, and @ref finish.
    The parsing events are realized through calls of
    protected virtual functions, whose implementations
    are in the derived class.

    <br>

    The parser may dynamically allocate intermediate
    storage as needed to accommodate the nesting level
    of the JSON being parsed. This storage is freed
    when the parser is destroyed, allowing the parser
    to cheaply re-use this memory when parsing
    subsequent JSONs, improving performance.

    @note

    The parser is strict: no extensions are supported.
    Only compliant JSON is recognized.

    @see @ref parse, @ref parser
